IMPORTANT NOTE ON SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

If you are connecting to a hosted runtime, make sure it has a P100 GPU (optionally run !nvidia-smi to confirm). Go to Edit>Notebook Settings to set this.

CoLab may first assign you a lower memory machine if you are using a hosted runtime.  If so, the first time you try to load the 5B model, it will run out of memory, and then you'll be prompted to restart with more memory (then return to the top of this CoLab).  If you continue to have memory issues after this (or run into issues on your own home setup), switch to the 1B model.

If you are using a local GPU, we recommend V100 or P100 with 16GB GPU memory for best performance. For GPUâ€™s with less memory, we recommend using the 1B model and a smaller batch size throughout.
